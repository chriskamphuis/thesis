	abstract="When researchers speak of BM25, it is not entirely clear which variant they mean, since many tweaks to Robertson et al.'s original formulation have been proposed. When practitioners speak of BM25, they most likely refer to the implementation in the Lucene open-source search library. Does this ambiguity ``matter''? We attempt to answer this question with a large-scale reproducibility study of BM25, considering eight variants. Experiments on three newswire collections show that there are no significant effectiveness differences between them, including Lucene's often maligned approximation of document length. As an added benefit, our empirical approach takes advantage of databases for rapid IR prototyping, which validates both the feasibility and methodological advantages claimed in previous work.",

These cards are composed of various elements, one of them being the entity summary: a selection of facts describing the entity from an underlying knowledge base. These summaries, while presenting a synopsis of the entity, can also directly address users' information needs. In this paper, we make the first effort towards generating and evaluating such factual summaries. We introduce and address the novel problem of dynamic entity summarization for entity cards, and break it down to two specific subtasks: fact ranking and summary generation. We perform an extensive evaluation of our method using crowdsourcing. Our results show the effectiveness of our fact ranking approach and validate that users prefer dynamic summaries over static ones.},

For rapid prototyping, this is particularly advantageous since researchers can explore new scoring functions and features by simply issuing SQL queries, without needing to write imperative code. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by an implementation of conjunctive BM25 using two modern column stores. Experiments on a web collection show that a retrieval engine built in this manner achieves effectiveness and efficiency on par with custom-built retrieval engines, but provides many additional advantages, including cleaner query semantics, a simpler architecture, built-in support for error analysis, and the ability to exploit advances in database technology "for free".},

	abstract = {In this paper, we reveal a common deficiency of the current retrieval models: the component of term frequency (TF) normalization by document length is not lower-bounded properly; as a result, very long documents tend to be overly penalized. In order to analytically diagnose this problem, we propose two desirable formal constraints to capture the heuristic of lower-bounding TF, and use constraint analysis to examine several representative retrieval functions. Analysis results show that all these retrieval functions can only satisfy the constraints for a certain range of parameter values and/or for a particular set of query terms. Empirical results further show that the retrieval performance tends to be poor when the parameter is out of the range or the query term is not in the particular set. To solve this common problem, we propose a general and efficient method to introduce a sufficiently large lower bound for TF normalization which can be shown analytically to fix or alleviate the problem. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, incurring almost no additional computational cost, can be applied to state-of-the-art retrieval functions, such as Okapi BM25, language models, and the divergence from randomness approach, to significantly improve the average precision, especially for verbose queries.},

The scale and shape of this TF normalization component is controlled by a parameter k1, which is generally set to a term-independent constant.

Following this intuition, we propose an information gain measure to directly estimate the contributions of repeated term occurrences, which is then exploited to fit the BM25 function to predict a term-specific k1. Our experiment results show that the proposed approach, without needing any training data, can efficiently and automatically estimate a term-specific k1, and is more effective and robust than the standard BM25.},

In this paper, we propose a further level of abstraction, claiming that the successive normalizations are carried out through composition. Thus we introduce a principled framework that fully explains BM25 as a variant of TF-IDF with an inverse order of function composition. Our experiments over standard datasets indicate that the respective orders of composition chosen in the original papers for both TF-IDF and BM25 are the most effective ones. Moreover, since the order is different between the two models, they also demonstrated that the order is instrumental in the design of weighting models. In fact, while considering more complex scoring functions such as BM25+, we discovered a novel weighting model in terms of order of composition that consistently outperforms all the rest. Our contribution here is twofold: we provide a unifying mathematical framework for IR and a novel scoring function discovered using this framework.},

Understanding how to leverage these entity annotations of text to improve ad hoc document retrieval is an open research area. Query expansion is a commonly used technique to improve retrieval effectiveness. Most previous query expansion approaches focus on text, mainly using unigram concepts. In this paper, we propose a new technique, called entity query feature expansion (EQFE) which enriches the query with features from entities and their links to knowledge bases, including structured attributes and text. We experiment using both explicit query entity annotations and latent entities. We evaluate our technique on TREC text collections automatically annotated with knowledge base entity links, including the Google Freebase Annotations (FACC1) data. We find that entity-based feature expansion results in significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art text expansion approaches.},

Existing studies in the literature consist of approaches that rank candidate venues based on different features of the venues and the user, which either focus on modeling the preferences of the user or the quality of the venue. However, while providing insightful results and conclusions, none of these studies have explored the relative effectiveness of these different features. In this paper, we explore a variety of user-dependent and venue-dependent features and apply state-of-the-art learning to rank approaches to the problem of contextual suggestion in order to find what makes a venue relevant for a given context. Using the test collection of the TREC 2013 Contextual Suggestion track, we perform a number of experiments to evaluate our approach. Our results suggest that a learning to rank technique can significantly outperform a Language Modelling baseline that models the positive and negative preferences of the user. Moreover, despite the fact that the contextual suggestion task is a personalisation task (i.e. providing the user with personalised suggestions of venues), we surprisingly find that user-dependent features are less effective than venue-dependent features for estimating the relevance of a suggestion.},

Modern learning to rank techniques based on regression trees can support query features, which are document-independent, and hence have the same values for all documents being ranked for a query. In doing so, such techniques are able to learn sub-trees that are specific to certain types of query. However, it is unclear which classes of features are useful for learning to rank, as previous studies leveraged anonymised features. In this work, we examine the usefulness of four classes of query features, based on topic classification, the history of the query in a query log, the predicted performance of the query, and the presence of concepts such as persons and organisations in the query. Through experiments on the ClueWeb09 collection, our results using a state-of-the-art learning to rank technique based on regression trees show that all four classes of query features can significantly improve upon an effective learned model that does not use any query feature.},

In particular, Pyserini supports sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25 scoring using bag-of-words representations), dense retrieval (e.g., nearest-neighbor search on transformer-encoded representations), as well as hybrid retrieval that integrates both approaches. This paper provides an overview of toolkit features and presents empirical results that illustrate its effectiveness on two popular ranking tasks.

Recent research even claims that BERT is able to capture factual knowledge about entity relations and properties, the information that is commonly obtained from knowledge graphs. This paper investigates the following question: Do BERT-based entity retrieval models benefit from additional entity information stored in knowledge graphs? To address this research question, we map entity embeddings into the same input space as a pre-trained BERT model and inject these entity embeddings into the BERT model. This entity-enriched language model is then employed on the entity retrieval task. We show that the entity-enriched BERT model improves effectiveness on entity-oriented queries over a regular BERT model, establishing a new state-of-the-art result for the entity retrieval task, with substantial improvements for complex natural language queries and queries requesting a list of entities with a certain property. Additionally, we show that the entity information provided by our entity-enriched model particularly helps queries related to less popular entities. Last, we observe empirically that the entity-enriched BERT models enable fine-tuning on limited training data, which otherwise would not be feasible due to the known instabilities of BERT in few-sample fine-tuning, thereby contributing to data-efficient training of BERT for entity search.},

In this work, the query and documents are modeled by word-based representations and entity-based representations. Ranking features are generated by the interactions between the two representations, incorporating information from the word space, the entity space, and the cross-space connections through the knowledge graph. To handle the uncertainties from the automatically constructed entity representations, an attention-based ranking model AttR-Duet is developed. With back-propagation from ranking labels, the model learns simultaneously how to demote noisy entities and how to rank documents with the word-entity duet. Evaluation results on TREC Web Track ad-hoc task demonstrate that all of the four-way interactions in the duet are useful, the attention mechanism successfully steers the model away from noisy entities, and together they significantly outperform both word-based and entity-based learning to rank systems.},

In this paper we focus on the tasks of identifying, ranking, and recommending entity aspects, and propose an approach that mines, clusters, and ranks such aspects from query logs. We perform large-scale experiments based on users' search sessions from actual query logs to evaluate the aspect ranking and recommendation tasks. In the aspect ranking task, we aim to satisfy most users' entity queries, and evaluate this task in a query-independent fashion. We find that entropy-based methods achieve the best performance compared to maximum likelihood and language modeling approaches. In the aspect recommendation task, we recommend other aspects related to the aspect currently being queried. We propose two approaches based on semantic relatedness and aspect transitions within user sessions and find that a combined approach gives the best performance. As an additional experiment, we utilize entity aspects for actual query recommendation and find that our approach improves the effectiveness of query recommendations built on top of the query-flow graph.},

The novelty is twofold: from the one hand, we have engineered the software in order to be modular and more efficient; from the other hand, we have improved the annotation pipeline by re-designing all of its three main modules: spotting, disambiguation and pruning. In particular, the re-design has involved the detailed inspection of the performance of these modules by developing new algorithms which have been in turn tested over all publicly available datasets (i.e. AIDA, IITB, MSN, AQUAINT, and the one of the ERD Challenge). This extensive experimentation allowed us to derive the best combination which achieved on the ERD development dataset an F1 score of 74.8%, which turned to be 67.2% F1 for the test dataset. This final result was due to an impressive precision equal to 87.6%, but very low recall 54.5%. With respect to classic TagME on the development dataset the improvement ranged from 1% to 9% on the D2W benchmark, depending on the disambiguation algorithm being used. As a side result, the final software can be interpreted as a flexible library of several parsing/disambiguation and pruning modules that can be used to build up new and more sophisticated entity annotators. We plan to release our library to the public as an open-source project.},

Entity linking systems often exploit relations between textual mentions in a document (e.g., coreference) to decide if the linking decisions are compatible. Unlike previous approaches, which relied on supervised systems or heuristics to predict these relations, we treat relations as latent variables in our neural entity-linking model. We induce the relations without any supervision while optimizing the entity-linking system in an end-to-end fashion. Our multi-relational model achieves the best reported scores on the standard benchmark (AIDA-CoNLL) and substantially outperforms its relation-agnostic version. Its training also converges much faster, suggesting that the injected structural bias helps to explain regularities in the training data.",

A core step in this process is that of identifying relevant content, i.e., filtering documents that would imply modifications to the attributes or relations of a given target entity. We propose two multi-step classification approaches for this task that consist of two and three binary classification steps, respectively. Both methods share the same initial component, which is concerned with the identification of entity mentions in documents, while subsequent steps involve identification of documents being relevant and/or central to a given entity.

Gradient tree boosting is a widely used machine learning algorithm that underlies many top-performing natural language processing systems. Surprisingly, most works limit the use of gradient tree boosting as a tool for regular classification or regression problems, despite the structured nature of language. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one that employs the structured gradient tree boosting (SGTB) algorithm for collective entity disambiguation. By defining global features over previous disambiguation decisions and jointly modeling them with local features, our system is able to produce globally optimized entity assignments for mentions in a document. Exact inference is prohibitively expensive for our globally normalized model. To solve this problem, we propose Bidirectional Beam Search with Gold path (BiBSG), an approximate inference algorithm that is a variant of the standard beam search algorithm. BiBSG makes use of global information from both past and future to perform better local search. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that SGTB significantly improves upon published results. Specifically, SGTB outperforms the previous state-of-the-art neural system by near 1{\%} absolute accuracy on the popular AIDA-CoNLL dataset.",

As such representations are the same for every query, our hypothesis is that the representations are not ideal for IR tasks. In this work, we present BERT Entity Representations (BERT-ER) which are query-specific vector representations of entities obtained from text that describes how an entity is relevant for a query. Using BERT-ER in a downstream entity ranking system, we achieve a performance improvement of 13-42% (Mean Average Precision) over a system that uses the BERT embedding of the introductory paragraph from Wikipedia on two large-scale test collections. Our approach also outperforms entity ranking systems using entity embeddings from Wikipedia2Vec, ERNIE, and E-BERT. We show that our entity ranking system using BERT-ER can increase precision at the top of the ranking by promoting relevant entities to the top. With this work, we release our BERT models and query-specific entity embeddings fine-tuned for the entity ranking task.},

To balance these two goals, we examine two approaches to providing interoperability between the inverted indexes of several systems. The first takes advantage of internal abstractions around index structures and building wrappers that allow one system to directly read the indexes of another. The second involves sharing indexes across systems via a data exchange specification that we have developed, called the Common Index File Format (CIFF). We demonstrate the first approach with the Java systems Anserini and Terrier, and the second approach with Anserini, JASSv2, OldDog, PISA, and Terrier. Together, these systems provide a wide range of implementations and features, with different research goals. Overall, we recommend CIFF as a low-effort approach to support independent innovation while enabling the types of fair evaluations that are critical for driving the field forward.},

We also show for which expressions extensional semantics yields the same results. Furthermore, we discuss complexity issues and indicate possibilities for optimization. With regard to databases, the approach allows for representing imprecise attribute values, whereas for information retrieval, probabilistic document indexing and probabilistic search term weighting can be modeled. We introduce the concept of vague predicates which yield probabilistic weights instead of Boolean values, thus allowing for queries with vague selection conditions.

Again, this has led to one of the most successful Web-search and corporate-search algorithms, BM25F. This work presents the PRF from a conceptual point of view, describing the probabilistic modelling assumptions behind the framework and the different ranking algorithms that result from its application: the binary independence model, relevance feedback models, BM25 and BM25F. It also discusses the relation between the PRF and other statistical models for IR, and covers some related topics, such as the use of non-textual features, and parameter optimisation for models with free parameters.},

While making use of the long-established Terrier IR platform for basic text indexing and retrieval, its salient utility comes from its expressive Python operators, which allow for individual IR operations to be pipelined and combined in different flexible manners as requested by the search application. Each operation applies a transformation upon a dataframe, while operators are defined with clear semantics in relational algebra. Going further, we have recently expanded the PyTerrier framework to include additional support for state-of-the-art BERT-based text re-rankers (such as EPIC) and dense retrieval implementations (such as ANCE and ColBERT). Transformer pipelines can be tuned and evaluated in a declarative manner. To increase the reusability of this framework as a resource for the IR community, PyTerrier provides easy access to a variety of standard benchmark datasets, including pre-built indices. Finally, we highlight the advantages of such a framework for information retrieval researchers and educators.},

Computations involving the graph structure are often separated from computations related to the base ranking. In recent years, graph data management has been a topic of interest in database research. We propose to deploy graph database management systems to implement existing and novel graph-based models for information retrieval. For this a unifying mapping from a graph query language to graph based retrieval models needs to be developed; extending standard graph database operations with functionality for keyword search. We also investigate how data structures and algorithms for ranking should change in presence of continuous database updates. We want to investigate how temporal decay can affect ranking when data is continuously updated. Finally, can databases be deployed for efficient two-stage retrieval approaches?",

Timely processing of updates is important with novel application domains such as e-commerce. These issues are challenging, given the additional requirement that the system must scale well. We have built PowerDB-IR, a system that has the characteristics sought. This article describes its design, implementation, and evaluation. We follow a three-tier architecture with a database cluster as the bottom layer for storage management. The rationale for a database cluster is to ‘scale out’, i.e., to add further cluster nodes, whenever necessary for better performance. The middle tier provides IR-specific retrieval and update services. We deploy state-of-the-art middleware software to coordinate the cluster and to invoke IR-specific components. PowerDB-IR extends the middleware layer with service decomposition and parallelisation. PowerDB-IR has the following features: It supports state-of-the-art retrieval models such as vector space retrieval. It allows documents to be inserted and retrieved concurrently and ensures up-to-date retrieval results with almost no overhead. PowerDB-IR ensures the correctness of global concurrency and recovery. Alternative physical data organisation schemes and respective query processing techniques provide adequate performance for different workloads and database sizes. Scaling out the database cluster yields higher throughput and lower response times. We have run extensive experiments with PowerDB-IR using several commercial database systems as well as different middleware products. Further experiments have quantified the effect of transactional guarantees on performance. The main result is that PowerDB-IR shows surprisingly good scalability and low response times.},

We provide computational support for exactly this framework with the array database system SRAM (Sparse Relational Array Mapping), that works on top of a DBMS. Information retrieval models can be specified in its comprehension-based array query language, in a way that directly corresponds to the underlying mathematical formulas. SRAM efficiently stores sparse arrays in (compressed) relational tables and translates and optimizes array queries into relational queries. In this work, we describe a number of array query optimization rules. To demonstrate their effect on text retrieval, we apply them in the TREC TeraByte track (TREC-TB) efficiency task, using the Okapi BM25 model as our example. It turns out that these optimization rules enable SRAM to automatically translate the BM25 array queries into the relational equivalent of inverted list processing including compression, score materialization and quantization, such as employed by custom-built IR systems. The use of the high-performance MonetDB/X100 relational backend, that provides transparent database compression, allows the system to achieve very fast response times with good precision and low resource usage.},

He provided anecdotal evidence that authors of neural IR papers demonstrate "wins" by comparing against weak baselines. This paper provides a rigorous evaluation of those claims in two ways: First, we conducted a meta-analysis of papers that have reported experimental results on the TREC Robust04 test collection. We do not find evidence of an upward trend in effectiveness over time. In fact, the best reported results are from a decade ago and no recent neural approach comes close. Second, we applied five recent neural models to rerank the strong baselines that Lin used to make his arguments. A significant improvement was observed for one of the models, demonstrating additivity in gains. While there appears to be merit to neural IR approaches, at least some of the gains reported in the literature appear illusory.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines a conceptual framework for understanding recent developments in information retrieval and natural language processing that attempts to integrate dense and sparse retrieval methods. I propose a representational approach that breaks the core text retrieval problem into a logical scoring model and a physical retrieval model. The scoring model is defined in terms of encoders, which map queries and documents into a representational space, and a comparison function that computes query-document scores. The physical retrieval model defines how a system produces the top-k scoring documents from an arbitrarily large corpus with respect to a query. The scoring model can be further analyzed along two dimensions: dense vs. sparse representations and supervised (learned) vs. unsupervised approaches. I show that many recently proposed retrieval methods, including multi-stage ranking designs, can be seen as different parameterizations in this framework, and that a unified view suggests a number of open research questions, providing a roadmap for future work. As a bonus, this conceptual framework establishes connections to sentence similarity tasks in natural language processing and information access "technologies" prior to the dawn of computing.},

We first construct EntityQuestions, a set of simple, entity-rich questions based on facts from Wikidata (e.g., {``}Where was Arve Furset born?{''}), and observe that dense retrievers drastically under-perform sparse methods. We investigate this issue and uncover that dense retrievers can only generalize to common entities unless the question pattern is explicitly observed during training. We discuss two simple solutions towards addressing this critical problem. First, we demonstrate that data augmentation is unable to fix the generalization problem. Second, we argue a more robust passage encoder helps facilitate better question adaptation using specialized question encoders. We hope our work can shed light on the challenges in creating a robust, universal dense retriever that works well across different input distributions.",

We then propose Lexicon-Enhanced Dense Retrieval (LEDR) as a simple yet effective way to enhance dense retrieval with lexical matching. We evaluate LaPraDoR on the recently proposed BEIR benchmark, including 18 datasets of 9 zero-shot text retrieval tasks. Experimental results show that LaPraDoR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with supervised dense retrieval models, and further analysis reveals the effectiveness of our training strategy and objectives.

However, pretrained language models alone do not fully capture information about uncommon entities. In this work, we investigate methods for enriching dense query and document representations with entity information from an external source. Our proposed method identifies groups of entities in a text and encodes them into a dense vector representation, which is then used to enrich BERT's vector representation of the text. To handle documents that contain many loosely-related entities, we devise a strategy for creating multiple entity representations that reflect different views of a document. For example, a document about a scientist may cover aspects of her personal life and recent work, which correspond to different views of the entity. In an evaluation on MS MARCO benchmarks, we find that enriching query and document representations in this way yields substantial increases in effectiveness.},

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

We present a two-stage zero-shot linking algorithm, where each entity is defined only by a short textual description. The first stage does retrieval in a dense space defined by a bi-encoder that independently embeds the mention context and the entity descriptions. Each candidate is then re-ranked with a cross-encoder, that concatenates the mention and entity text. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is state of the art on recent zero-shot benchmarks (6 point absolute gains) and also on more established non-zero-shot evaluations (e.g. TACKBP-2010), despite its relative simplicity (e.g. no explicit entity embeddings or manually engineered mention tables). We also show that bi-encoder linking is very fast with nearest neighbor search (e.g. linking with 5.9 million candidates in 2 milliseconds), and that much of the accuracy gain from the more expensive cross-encoder can be transferred to the bi-encoder via knowledge distillation.

	abstract = {Over the last few years, contextualized pre-trained transformer models such as BERT have provided substantial improvements on information retrieval tasks. Traditional sparse retrieval methods such as BM25 rely on high-dimensional, sparse, bag-of-words query representations to retrieve documents. On the other hand, recent approaches based on pre-trained transformer models such as BERT, fine-tune dense low-dimensional contextualized representations of queries and documents in embedding space. While these dense retrievers enjoy substantial retrieval effectiveness improvements compared to sparse retrievers, they are computationally intensive, requiring substantial GPU resources, and dense retrievers are known to be more expensive from both time and resource perspectives. In addition, sparse retrievers have been shown to retrieve complementary information with respect to dense retrievers, leading to proposals for hybrid retrievers. These hybrid retrievers leverage low-cost, exact-matching based sparse retrievers along with dense retrievers to bridge the semantic gaps between query and documents. In this work, we address this trade-off between the cost and utility of sparse vs dense retrievers by proposing a classifier to select a suitable retrieval strategy (i.e., sparse vs. dense vs. hybrid) for individual queries. Leveraging sparse retrievers for queries which can be answered with sparse retrievers decreases the number of calls to GPUs. Consequently, while utility is maintained, query latency decreases. Although we use less computational resources and spend less time, we still achieve improved performance. Our classifier can select between sparse and dense retrieval strategies based on the query alone. We conduct experiments on the MS MARCO passage dataset demonstrating an improved range of efficiency/effectiveness trade-offs between purely sparse, purely dense or hybrid retrieval strategies, allowing an appropriate strategy to be selected based on a target latency and resource budget.},

Although academic information retrieval researchers have a long history of building and sharing systems, they are primarily designed to facilitate the publication of research papers. As such, these systems are often incomplete, inflexible, poorly documented, difficult to use, and slow, particularly in the context of modern web-scale collections. Furthermore, the growing complexity of modern software ecosystems and the resource constraints most academic research groups operate under make maintaining open-source systems a constant struggle. However, except for a small number of companies (mostly commercial web search engines) that deploy custom infrastructure, Lucene has become the de facto platform in industry for building search applications. Lucene has an active developer base, a large audience of users, and diverse capabilities to work with heterogeneous collections at scale. However, it lacks systematic support for ad hoc experimentation using standard test collections. We describe Anserini, an information retrieval toolkit built on Lucene that fills this gap. Our goal is to simplify ad hoc experimentation and allow researchers to easily reproduce results with modern bag-of-words ranking models on diverse test collections. With Anserini, we demonstrate that Lucene provides a suitable framework for supporting information retrieval research. Experiments show that our system efficiently indexes large web collections, provides modern ranking models that are on par with research implementations in terms of effectiveness, and supports low-latency query evaluation to facilitate rapid experimentation},

	abstract = {During the recent years and with the growing influence of neural architectures, tasks such as ad hoc retrieval have witnessed an impressive improvement in performance. For instance, the performance of rankers on the passage retrieval task on the MS MARCO dataset has improved by an order of magnitude in less than two years. In this paper, we go beyond the overall performance of the state of the art rankers and empirically study their performance from a finer-grained perspective. We find that while neural rankers have been able to consistently improve performance, this has been in part thanks to a specific set of queries from within the larger query set. We systematically show that there are subsets of queries that are difficult for each and every one of the neural rankers, which we refer to as obstinate queries. We show the obstinate queries are similar to easier queries in terms of their number of available relevant judgement documents and the length of the query itself but they are extremely more difficult to satisfy by existing rankers. Furthermore, we observe that query reformulation methods cannot help these queries. On this basis, we present three datasets derived from the MS MARCO Dev set, called the MS MARCO Chameleon datasets. We believe that the next breakthrough in performance would need to necessarily consider the queries in the MS MARCO Chameleons, as such, propose that a well-rounded evaluation strategy for any new ranker would need to include performance measures on both the overall MS MARCO dataset as well as the proposed MS MARCO Chameleon datasets.},

We evaluate QLever on two large datasets, including FACC (the ClueWeb12 corpus linked to Freebase). We compare against three state-of-the-art query engines for knowledge bases with varying support for text search: RDF-3X, Virtuoso, Broccoli. Query times are competitive and often faster on the pure SPARQL queries, and several orders of magnitude faster on the SPARQL+Text queries.

Recently, it has also been applied to information retrieval. According to this new paradigm, each document is viewed as a language sample, and a query as a generation process. The retrieved documents are ranked based on the probabilities of producing a query from the corresponding language models of these documents. In this paper, we will present a new language model for information retrieval, which is based on a range of data smoothing techniques, including the Good-Turning estimate, curve-fitting functions, and model combinations. Our model is conceptually simple and intuitive, and can be easily extended to incorporate probabilities of phrases such as word pairs and word triples. The experiments with the Wall Street Journal and TREC4 data sets showed that the performance of our model is comparable to that of INQUERY and better than that of another language model for information retrieval. In particular, word pairs are shown to be useful in improving the retrieval performance.},

In this paper, we propose a family of two-stage language models for information retrieval that explicitly captures the different influences of the query and document collection on the optimal settings of retrieval parameters. As a special case, we present a two-stage smoothing method that allows us to estimate the smoothing parameters completely automatically. In the first stage, the document language model is smoothed using a Dirichlet prior with the collection language model as the reference model. In the second stage, the smoothed document language model is further interpolated with a query background language model. We propose a leave-one-out method for estimating the Dirichlet parameter of the first stage, and the use of document mixture models for estimating the interpolation parameter of the second stage. Evaluation on five different databases and four types of queries indicates that the two-stage smoothing method with the proposed parameter estimation methods consistently gives retrieval performance that is close to---or better than---the best results achieved using a single smoothing method and exhaustive parameter search on the test data.},

Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716 A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired. Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.}

Such comparisons, however, are rarely made. Most researchers only report results from their own experiments, a practice that allows lack of overall improvement to go unnoticed. In this paper, we analyze results achieved on the TREC Ad-Hoc, Web, Terabyte, and Robust collections as reported in SIGIR (1998--2008) and CIKM (2004--2008). Dozens of individual published experiments report effectiveness improvements, and often claim statistical significance. However, there is little evidence of improvement in ad-hoc retrieval technology over the past decade. Baselines are generally weak, often being below the median original TREC system. And in only a handful of experiments is the score of the best TREC automatic run exceeded. Given this finding, we question the value of achieving even a statistically significant result over a weak baseline. We propose that the community adopt a practice of regular longitudinal comparison to ensure measurable progress, or at least prevent the lack of it from going unnoticed. We describe an online database of retrieval runs that facilitates such a practice.},

One is that many evaluations only use aggregate measures (like precision, recall, and F1 score), without a detailed error analysis or a closer look at the results. The other is that all of the widely used benchmarks have strong biases and artifacts, in particular: a strong focus on named entities, an unclear or missing specification of what else counts as an entity mention, poor handling of ambiguities, and an over- or underrepresentation of certain kinds of entities. We provide a more meaningful and fair in-depth evaluation of a variety of existing end-to-end entity linkers. We characterize their strengths and weaknesses and also report on reproducibility aspects. The detailed results of our evaluation can be inspected under https://elevant.cs.uni-freiburg.de/emnlp2023.

The basic idea of these approaches is to estimate a language model for each document, and to then rank documents by the likelihood of the query according to the estimated language model. A central issue in language model estimation is smoothing, the problem of adjusting the maximum likelihood estimator to compensate for data sparseness. In this article, we study the problem of language model smoothing and its influence on retrieval performance. We examine the sensitivity of retrieval performance to the smoothing parameters and compare several popular smoothing methods on different test collections. Experimental results show that not only is the retrieval performance generally sensitive to the smoothing parameters, but also the sensitivity pattern is affected by the query type, with performance being more sensitive to smoothing for verbose queries than for keyword queries. Verbose queries also generally require more aggressive smoothing to achieve optimal performance. This suggests that smoothing plays two different role---to make the estimated document language model more accurate and to "explain" the noninformative words in the query. In order to decouple these two distinct roles of smoothing, we propose a two-stage smoothing strategy, which yields better sensitivity patterns and facilitates the setting of smoothing parameters automatically. We further propose methods for estimating the smoothing parameters automatically. Evaluation on five different databases and four types of queries indicates that the two-stage smoothing method with the proposed parameter estimation methods consistently gives retrieval performance that is close to---or better than---the best results achieved using a single smoothing method and exhaustive parameter search on the test data.},

	abstract = {We present an efficient query evaluation method based on a two level approach: at the first level, our method iterates in parallel over query term postings and identifies candidate documents using an approximate evaluation taking into account only partial information on term occurrences and no query independent factors; at the second level, promising candidates are fully evaluated and their exact scores are computed. The efficiency of the evaluation process can be improved significantly using dynamic pruning techniques with very little cost in effectiveness. The amount of pruning can be controlled by the user as a function of time allocated for query evaluation. Experimentally, using the TREC Web Track data, we have determined that our algorithm significantly reduces the total number of full evaluations by more than 90\%, almost without any loss in precision or recall. At the heart of our approach there is an efficient implementation of a new Boolean construct called WAND or Weak AND that might be of independent interest.},

	abstract = {Modern large retrieval environments tend to overwhelm their users by their large output. Since all documents are not of equal relevance to their users, highly relevant documents should be identified and ranked first for presentation. In order to develop IR techniques in this direction, it is necessary to develop evaluation approaches and methods that credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This can be done by extending traditional evaluation methods, that is, recall and precision based on binary relevance judgments, to graded relevance judgments. Alternatively, novel measures based on graded relevance judgments may be developed. This article proposes several novel measures that compute the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. The first one accumulates the relevance scores of retrieved documents along the ranked result list. The second one is similar but applies a discount factor to the relevance scores in order to devaluate late-retrieved documents. The third one computes the relative-to-the-ideal performance of IR techniques, based on the cumulative gain they are able to yield. These novel measures are defined and discussed and their use is demonstrated in a case study using TREC data: sample system run results for 20 queries in TREC-7. As a relevance base we used novel graded relevance judgments on a four-point scale. The test results indicate that the proposed measures credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents and allow testing of statistical significance of effectiveness differences. The graphs based on the measures also provide insight into the performance IR techniques and allow interpretation, for example, from the user point of view.},

We contrast the new systems on their data model, consistency mechanisms, storage mechanisms, durability guarantees, availability, query support, and other dimensions. These systems typically sacrifice some of these dimensions, e.g. database-wide transaction consistency, in order to achieve others, e.g. higher availability and scalability.},

The scale of these graphs - in some cases billions of vertices, trillions of edges - poses challenges to their efficient processing. In this paper we present a computational model suitable for this task. Programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations, in each of which a vertex can receive messages sent in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, and modify its own state and that of its outgoing edges or mutate graph topology. This vertex-centric approach is flexible enough to express a broad set of algorithms. The model has been designed for efficient, scalable and fault-tolerant implementation on clusters of thousands of commodity computers, and its implied synchronicity makes reasoning about programs easier. Distribution-related details are hidden behind an abstract API. The result is a framework for processing large graphs that is expressive and easy to program.},

For other DFR models and a revised Okapi implementation, performance differences between approaches using short or long stopword lists or no list at all are usually not statistically significant.
